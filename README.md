- 👋 Hi, I’m @cysectools
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity & Malware Analysis
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Malware Development & Reverse Enginneering tool (Ghidra)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing...
- 📫 How to reach me email me or message me here, i dunno, im new.
- 😄 Pronouns: The way God intended!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to create programs called 'fun-ware'. It's basically malware for trolling but I beleive that "malware" has a bad connatation associated with it.
